# tensorflowWork

All repos' here are work done from udacity's deep learning course.

## Tech
* [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) - an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - A library for helping in matrix
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) - A data analysis tool
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - A neural network open source library.

## Get it started

  1) Git clone the folder to your computer
  2) Run the jupyternote book from any repos you like. ( make sure you have either Anaconda or virtual env running jupyternotebook )
  3) Run each block of code to see what happens at each step.
  
# Break down
The repos varies from CNN network to RNN network learning basics of NLP and different type of ways to connect words for example w2v.
